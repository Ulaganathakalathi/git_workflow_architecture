This project is amined for product releases that should happen on 25th of every month.

Git Workflow Architecture is used as development process for this project.

 Branches:
	permanent branches:
		master : Branch stores the official release history.
		develop : Branch serves as an integration branch for features.
		
	temparory branches:
		feature : Each new feature should reside in its own branch.
		          Feature branches use develop as their parent branch.
				  Feature branches should created off from the latest develop branch.
				  Once the feature is implemented, merge feature branch to develop branch and delete feature branch.
		release : Once develop branch has acquired enough features for a release 
		          (or a predetermined release date is approaching), release branch frok off from develop branch.
				  No new features can be added after this point, only bug fixes, documentation generation, and 
				  other release-oriented tasks should go in this branch.
				  Once it's ready to ship, the release branch gets merged into master and tagged with a version number.
				  Incase of any additional commits on release branch, it should be merged back into develop.
				  Once release done, delete release branch
		hotfix : branches are used to quickly patch production releases. 
		         Hotfix branches are a lot like release branches and feature branches except they're based on master instead of develop. 
				 This is the only branch that should fork directly off of master. 
				 As soon as the fix is complete, it should be merged into both master and develop (or the current release branch), 
				 and master should be tagged with an updated version number.
				  
Example git workflow from start to end of a release:
	step 1: check and confirm develop branch is fork with latest updated on master branch
	Step 2: Clone the project repository to the local
			Example: use below command to clone the branch develop to the local
	        git clone -b develop <repository-url>

	step 3: create feature branches from the develop branch.
	        this example considered only one feature for this release.
			Example: use below command to create a feature branch:
				git checkout develop
				git checkout -b feature_branch
	
	step 4: Once the feature is implemented on the feature branch, merge the feature branch to develop branch and delete the feature branch
	        Example: command below
				git checkout develop
				git merge feature_branch
				git branch -d feature_branch
	
	step 5: Once the develop branch is ready for release, create release branch from the develope branch
			Example: command below
				git checkout develop
				git checkout -b release_branch
				
	step 6: Once release branch is ready to ship, the release branch gets merged into master and tagged with a version number.
			Example: command below
				git checkout master
				git merge release_branch
				git tag -a v0.1 -m “sdk version 0.1"
				
	step 7: Incase of any additional commits on release branch (such as bug fixes, documentation generation, other release-oriented tasks), 
	        it should be merged back into develop
			Example: command below
				git checkout develop
				git merge release_branch
				
	Step 8: delete the release branch, once the release complete
			Example: command below
				git branch -d release_branch
				
	Step 9: Incase of any quickly patch production releases:
			create hotfix branch and use for the quick fix
				Example: command below
					git checkout master
					git checkout -b hotfix_branch
			perform the fix and commit the changes
				Example: command below
					git add .
					git commit -m “added urgent.txt file on hotfix branch”

			Once fix is complete and committed, it should be merged into both master and develop branch, and master should be tagged with an updated version number.
				Example: command below
					git checkout master
					git merge hotfix_branch
					git tag -a v0.2 -m “sdk version 0.2"
					git checkout develop
					git merge master

	Repeate the step 1 to step 9 for each releases.
